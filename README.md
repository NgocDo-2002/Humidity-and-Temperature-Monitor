# Outdoor Humidity and Temperature Monitor

The project was made with the purpose of learning and researching Embedded Systems Design. The scope of this project is to design and develop a temperature and humidity measurement system using DHT22 sensor, microcontroller STM32 L152-RE board and use MODBUS to establish master and slave communication. A simple circuit made to connect microcontroller, sensor together.
