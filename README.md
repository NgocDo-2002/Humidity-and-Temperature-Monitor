# Outdoor Humidity and Temperature Monitor

The project was made with the purpose of learning and researching Embedded Systems Design. This project also mentions the limitations and capabilities of the DHT22 sensor in temperature and humidity measurement. The scope of this project is to design and develop a temperature and humidity measurement system using DHT22 sensor, microcontroller L152-RE board and use MODBUS to establish master and slave communication. A simple circuit made to connect microcontroller, sensor together..
